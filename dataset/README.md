## Naming convention
Files are named according to the following convention:

First acquisition:
```
rxSig_<SNR value>dB_HT<HT-CC attack>.mat
```

Second acquisition:
```
rxSig_<SNR value>dB_HT<HT-CC attack>_.mat
```
+ SNR value: ranging from 1dB to 29dB with a step of 4dB, i.e., <1>=SNR of 1db, <2>=SNR of 5db, <3>=SNR of 9dB, <4>=SNR of 13dB, <5>=SNR of 17dB, <6>=SNR of 21dB, <7>=SNR of 25dB, <8>=SNR of 29dB.
+ HT-CC attack: CC-free (HT0-CC) and CC-infected (HTX-CC, X={1, · · · , 4}).
